  Deltacloud uses basic HTTP
  %a{:href=>"api.html#h1_3"}
    authentication
  to receive credentials from the
  client and passes them through to the backend cloud it is talking to. The
  credentials always consist of a username and password, and are never
  stored on the server.  The exact credentials for logging into the server,
  and where you find them, depends on the backend cloud that the server is
  talking to.
%a(name="credentials")
%p
  The following table gives details about the credentials that must be
  provided for each of the supported clouds. The entry from
  the Driver column needs to be passed as the
  %tt
    \-i
  option to the
  %tt
    deltacloudd
  server daemon. Note that some of the drivers require additional information, e.g.,
  API endpoint URL's, be passed through environment variables, as addressed in the
  %a{:href=>"drivers.html#specific_driver_notes"}
    Notes
  for Specific Drivers section below.
