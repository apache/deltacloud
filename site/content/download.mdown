Deltacloud provides the API server and drivers necessary for connecting
to the [cloud providers](./drivers.html#providers "Deltacloud drivers").
Install Deltacloud and start the ***deltacloudd*** daemon server. You can use your
favourite HTTP client to talk to the server using the
[Deltacloud REST API](api.html "Deltacloud REST API"). Deltacloud even comes with a
HTML interface so you can simply use your web browser to control your cloud
infrastructure straight out of the box. As of Deltacloud 0.4.0, the HTML interface
is written with the [jQuery mobile](http://jquerymobile.com "jquery mobile")
framework so it plays especially well with your mobile or tablet devices.

This page lists the location of the main 'bits' of Deltacloud - for more detailed
information on getting and installing Deltacloud checkout out our
[installation and quick start guide](documentation.html#install_deltacloud).

# Get Deltacloud #

Deltacloud is available as a ruby gem. First make sure you have installed all the
[required dependencies](documentation.html#dependencies),
Then installing Deltacloud is as easy as typing:

    $ sudo gem install deltacloud-core

**And thats it!** Yes, really. The **gem install** command will automatically fetch and install
all other gems that the Deltacloud server needs if you don't already have these.

As an alternative you can get the latest releases of Deltacloud from the
[Apache website](http://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/deltacloud/).

## Getting the sources ##

More information for developers is available [here](developers.html).

The Apache Deltacloud subversion repo is at:
**https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/deltacloud**.

    svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/deltacloud deltacloud

The Git repo is at: **git://git.apache.org/deltacloud.git**

    git clone git://git.apache.org/deltacloud.git

# The Deltacloud Ruby Client #

The Deltacloud project also maintains a ruby client, which you need to install
separately to the Deltacloud API server. The Deltacloud client consists of a
 ruby library (packaged as a ruby gem) which you can use to programmatically
interact with the Deltacloud server and control your cloud infrastructure
across cloud providers.

Assuming you already setup the [required dependencies](documentation.html#dependencies),
you can install the Deltacloud by simply typing:

    $ sudo gem install deltacloud-client

Installing the Deltacloud client also gives you the **deltacloudc** command line
tool. This executable makes use of the Deltacloud client library to speak to the
Deltacloud server using the [REST API](api.html). More information on getting started
with the Deltacloud Ruby client is available in the
[quick start guide](documentation.html#quick_start).
