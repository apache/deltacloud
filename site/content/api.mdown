## 1. Introduction

Apache Deltacloud is a REST-based (HATEOAS) cloud abstraction API, that enables
management of resources in different IaaS clouds using a single API. A series of
 back-end drivers 'speak' each cloud provider's native API and the Deltacloud Core
 Framework provides the basis for implementing drivers as needed for other/new IaaS
cloud providers. Apache Deltacloud currently supports many back-end cloud providers,
 as listed in [Drivers](./drivers.html).

The Apache Deltacloud project empowers its users in avoiding lockin to any single
cloud provider. Deltacloud provides an API abstraction that can be implemented as a
 wrapper around a large number of clouds, freeing users of cloud from dealing with the
particulars of each cloud's API.

* * *

### 1.1 Collections

The following terms represent the abstractions used in the Apache Deltacloud API and
are introduced here to aid the reader. Each represents an entity in the 'back-end'
provider cloud such as a running virtual server or a server image. It should be
noted that not all clouds support all of the following entity collections. Only
 the appropriate entity collections are exposed for a given back-end driver
(e.g. the Microsoft Azure driver currently exposes only the 'Buckets' collection).

##### Realms

A distinct organizational unit within the back-end cloud such as a datacenter.
A realm may but does not necessarily represent the geographical location of the
compute resources being accessed.

##### Instances

 A realized virtual server, running in a given back-end cloud. These are instantiated
from server Images.

##### Images

These are templates (virtual machine images) from which Instances are created.
Each Image defines the root partition and initial storage for the Instance operating system.

##### Instance States

These represent the Instance lifecycle; at any time an Instance will be in one of
 *start, pending, running, stopped, stopping, finished*.

##### Keys

These represent credentials used to access a running Instance. These can be of type
*key* (e.g., an *RSA* key), or of type *password* (i.e., with *username* and
*password* attributes).

##### Storage\_Volume

This is a virtual storage device that can be attached to an Instance and mounted
by the OS therein.

##### Storage\_Snapshot

These are copies, snapshots of a Storage\_Volume at a specified point in time.

##### Bucket

A container for data blobs. The organisational unit of a generic *key* ==> *value*
 based data store (such as Rackspace CloudFiles or Amazon S3). Individual data
items, *Blobs*, are exposed as a subcollection under a bucket.

##### Blob

A generic binary data item that exists with a specified bucket (an `object' in
 Amazon S3 and Rackspace CloudFiles).

##### Address

Represents an IP addresses. Depending on the back-end cloud provider addresses
can be 'public' in which case they represent a unique, globally routable IP
address, or 'private' in which case they represent an address routable only
within a private network.

##### Load Balancer

Allows distribution of ingress network traffic received by a specified IP address
to a number of instances.

##### Firewalls

Represent sets of rules that govern the accessibility of a running instance over
the public Internet

### 1.2 Client Requests

In keeping with REST, clients make requests through HTTP, with the usual
meanings assigned to the standard HTTP verbs GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

Beyond the generally accepted REST design principles, Apache Deltacloud
follows the guidelines discussed in the Fedora Project [Cloud APIs Rest Style Guide](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Cloud_APIs_REST_Style_Guide "Fedora Cloud APIs REST Style Guide").

The URL space of the API is structured into collections of resources
(entities, objects). The top level entities used in the Deltacloud API are:
Realms, Images, Instance States, Instances, Keys, Storage Volume,
Storage Snapshots, Blob Storage.

### 1.3 Authentication

The Deltacloud API server is stateless, and does not keep any information
about the current client. In particular, it does not store the credentials for
the backend cloud it is talking to. Instead, it uses HTTP basic authentication,
and clients have to send the username/password for the backend cloud on every request.

The specifics of what needs to be sent varies from cloud to cloud; some
cloud providers employ a username and password for API access, whilst
others use special-purpose API keys. A list of the credentials that a given
cloud provider expects for API access is
[available here](drivers.html#credentials)

### 1.4 Server responses

The server can respond to client requests in a variety of formats. The
appropriate response format is determined by HTTP content negotiation.
The primary format is XML, which is the basis for this document. Output is
also available as JSON and, mostly for testing, as HTML. Clients can also
explicitly request a specific response format by including the
'format=' request parameter (e.g., http://deltacloudserver.foo/api?format=xml
or http://deltacloudserver.foo/api?format=json).

In general and especially for the html inteface, list operations such as
`GET /api/realms` will only provide a list of the objects of this resource type
with only brief details; full details can be retrieved by making a request
`GET /api/realms/:id` to the URL of the individual realm.

### 1.5 API conventions

Any XML element that represents an object, such as an instance has an
href and a id attribute. The href provides the URL at which object-specific
actions can be performed (e.g., a GET to the URL will give details
of the object). The id provides an identifier of the object and this is unique
within its collection (i.e., unique id for each Instance, Image, Realm etc).

Generally, objects also have a human-readable name; the name is provided in a
`<name/>` child element of the object’s container tag.

### 1.6 API stability and evolution

Future changes to the API will be made in a manner that allows old clients
to work against newer versions of the the API server.

The stability guarantees given by the Apache Deltacloud API imply that the
following changes may happen in newer versions of the API:

  * adding new collections, or supporting new operations on existing collections
  * adding optional parameters to existing operations
  * adding additional attributes and elements to the XML/JSON responses

On the other hand, these changes would violate API stability and will therefore
not be made:

  * removing an operation on a collection
  * making an optional parameter for an operation mandatory
  * removing attributes or elements from XML responses

### 1.7 Online documentation

Automatically generated documentation can be accessed on every server running
the Deltacloud Core API service through the URL `http://localhost:3001/api/docs/`.
The documentation is both available in HTML and XML, though the XML format is not
part of this specification, and may change in an incompatible way.

## 2. The API entry point

Any part of the official API can be reached through the main entry point,
by default http://localhost:3001/api. The entry point list the resources
the server knows about for the current cloud provider; for the Amazon EC2
driver for example, these are:

* Instances
* Instance states
* Images
* Realms
* Hardware profiles
* Keys
* Buckets
* Storage volumes
* Storage snapshots
* Load Balancers
* Addresses
* Firewalls

`Example request:`

    GET /api?format=xml HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Basic AU1J3UB2121Afd1DdyQWxLaTYTmJMNF4zTXBoRGdhMDh2RUw5ZDAN9zVXVa==

      <link href='http://localhost:3001/api/load_balancers' rel='load_balancers'>
      </link>
    </api>


Specific implementations for the Apache Deltacloud API may not support all resource
types defined by this API. For example, a Deltacloud instance pointing at a storage-only
service will not expose compute resources like instances and hardware profiles.

### 2.1 Features

The Apache Deltacloud API defines the standard behavior and semantics
for each of the resource types as a baseline for any API implementation; it
is often desirable to enhance standard API behavior with specific features.
The API also defines all the features that can be supported by an API
implementation - each of them has a fixed, predefined meaning. As an
example, the feature user-name indicates that a user-specified name can be
assigned to an instance when it is created. Features are advertised in the
top-level entry point as illustrated below:

    <api driver='mock' version='0.3.0'>
      ...
      <link href='http://localhost:3001/api/instances' rel='instances'>
        <feature name='hardware_profiles'></feature>
        <feature name='user_name'></feature>
        <feature name='authentication_key'></feature>
      </link>
      ...
    </api>

The following describes the features available to each collection in
the Deltacloud API together with a brief description:

    Feature                 Collection   Operation             Description

## 3. Compute Resources

The compute resources are ***instances, instance states, images, realms, hardware profiles,
firewalls, load balancers, addresses*** and ***keys***.


### 3.1 Realms

A ***realm*** represents a boundary containing resources, such as a data
center. The exact definition of a ***realm*** is left to the cloud provider.
In some cases, a ***realm*** may represent different datacenters, different continents,
or different pools of resources within a single datacenter. A cloud provider may
insist that resources must all exist within a single ***realm*** in order to cooperate.
For instance, storage volumes may only be allowed to be mounted to instances within
the same ***realm***. Generally speaking, going from one ***realm*** to another within
the same cloud may change many aspects of the cloud, such as SLA’s, pricing terms, etc.

#### `GET /api/realms`

List all realms. Can be filtered by adding a request parameter ***architecture***
to the realms that support a specific ***architecture*** such as ***i386***. The example
below shows the retrieval of all ***realms*** for the AWS EC2 driver, which correspond
to EC2 "availability zones":

`Example request:`

    GET /api/realms?format=xml HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Basic AU1J3UB2121Afd1DdyQWxLaTYTmJMNF4zTXBoRGdhMDh2RUw5ZDAN9zVXVa==
    User-Agent: curl/7.20.1 (i386-redhat-linux-gnu)
    Host: localhost:3001
    Accept: */*

`Server response:`

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/xml
    Content-Length: 639
    <?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8' ?>
    <realms>
      <realm href='http://localhost:3001/api/realms/us-east-1a' id='us-east-1a'>
        <name>us-east-1a</name>
        <state>available</state>
      </realm>
      <realm href='http://localhost:3001/api/realms/us-east-1b' id='us-east-1b'>
        <name>us-east-1b</name>
        <state>available</state>
      </realm>
      <realm href='http://localhost:3001/api/realms/us-east-1c' id='us-east-1c'>
        <name>us-east-1c</name>
        <state>available</state>
      </realm>
      <realm href='http://localhost:3001/api/realms/us-east-1d' id='us-east-1d'>
        <name>us-east-1d</name>
        <state>available</state>
      </realm>
    </realms>

#### `GET /api/realms/:id`

Provide the details of a ***realm***. Currently, these are a **name**, a  **state** and a
 **limit** applicable to the current requester. The ***name*** is an arbitrary label
with no specific meaning in the API. The **state** can be either **AVAILABLE**
 or **UNAVAILABLE**. The example below shows the ***realm*** for the Rackspace driver.
Since Rackspace does not currently have a notion of ***realms*** the Deltacloud
Rackspace driver provides a single ***realm*** called 'US', signifying that all
compute resources for that cloud provider are hosted in the United States:

`Example request:`

    GET /api/realms/us?format=xml HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Basic AU1J3UB2121Afd1DdyQWxLaTYTmJMNF4zTXBoRGdhMDh2RUw5ZDAN9zVXVa==
    User-Agent: curl/7.20.1 (i386-redhat-linux-gnu)
    Host: localhost:3002
    Accept: */*

`Server response:`

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/xml
    Content-Length: 182

    <?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8' ?>
    <realm href='http://localhost:3001/api/realms/us' id='us'>
        <name>United States</name>
        <state>AVAILABLE</state>
        <limit></limit>
    </realm>

### 3.2 Hardware Profiles

A ***hardware profile*** describes the sizing of a virtual machine in a cloud and
prescribes details such as how many virtual CPUs, how much memory or
how much local storage an instance might have. The attributes of a ***hardware profile***
consist of a human-readable ***name*** and a list of ***<property/>*** elements.
Each property defines possible values along a sizing dimension.

Since clouds differ sharply in how virtual machine sizing is represented
and influenced, hardware profiles provide a generic mechanism to express sizing
constraints. For each dimension (amount of memory etc.), the hardware
profile can express one of the following:

1. Size is **fixed** in this dimension, e.g. instances all have 2GB of memory, *or*
2. Size can be varied freely within some **range**, e.g. instances can have
   from 1GB to 4GB of memory, *or*
3. Size can be chosen from a predefined set of values, an **enumeration**,
   e.g., instances can have 512 MB, 1 GB or 4GB of memory.

When creating a new ***instance***, a client must specify the ***hardware profile***
on which the ***instance*** is based.

In addition to the sizing constraints, a hardware profile may also indicate the
parameters (if any) that can be specified by a client in ***instance*** operations.
These user-defined, variable dimensions are denoted by a *\<param\>* XML tag within
the given property. For instance, the following extract shows the *memory* dimension
for a hardware profile that can be specified in the HTTP POST *create* operation of the
***instances*** collection (i.e., creating a new instance). The given parameter must be
specified using the name *hwp_memory*, its default value is *10240* but the client may
specify a value in the range *7680* upto *15360*:

    ...
    <property kind='range' name='memory' unit='MB' value='10240'>
        <param href='http://localhost:3003/api/instances' method='post' name='hwp_memory' operation='create' />
        <range first='7680.0' last='15360' />
    </property>
    ...

#### `GET /api/hardware_profiles`

Produce a list if all ***hardware profiles*** availaible with this cloud. The example
below lists the hardware profiles available in the Amazon EC2 cloud. As EC2 provides
a set of pre-defined ***hardware profiles***, the properties of each dimension
(memory,cpu etc) are of type *fixed*:

`Example request:`

    GET /api/hardware_profiles?format=xml HTTP/1.1

#### `GET /api/hardware profiles/:id`

This call retrieves the details of a specific ***hardware profile***.
The example below shows a request for the *m1-large* profile of the Deltacloud *mock* driver.
 This ***hardware profile*** demonstrates the three different types of parameters (i.e.,
 *fixed*, *range*, *enum*). The example shows that ***instances*** launched with this
 ***hardware profile*** will have exactly *2* virtual CPUs, memory in the range *7.5* to
*15GB* and local storage that can either be 850MB or 1GB. The default value for
each dimension is indicated by the value attribute on the property element:

### 3.3 Images

***Images*** are used to launch ***instances***. Each ***image*** represents
a virtual machine image in the back-end cloud, containing the root
partition and initial storage for an instance operating system.

An ***image*** has human-readable *name* and *description*, an *owner_id*
that identifies the user account to which the ***image*** belongs, as well as
an *architecture* and a *state*. The *architecture* attribute refers to whether the
***image*** will create an ***instance*** with *32* or *64* bit processor; the values
that the Deltacloud server returns for this attribute are thus *i386* and *x86_64* respectively.
The *state* attribute is as reported by the cloud provider and so will vary between back-end clouds.
For example AWS EC2 ***image*** state can be one of *AVAILABLE*, *PENDING* or *FAILED*
whereas Rackspace Cloudservers ***image*** state can be one of *UNKNOWN*, *PREPARING*,
 *ACTIVE*, *QUEUED* or *FAILED*. Finally, each ***image*** also contains an \<actions\>
attribute that specifies the URI to which a client may issue a **HTTP POST** for creation of
an ***instance*** from the given ***image***.

<a name=list_images>.
#### `GET /api/images`

Return a list of all ***images*** available in the back-end cloud. By default this call will
return **all** images that are available to the given user account. Optionally a client
may restrict the list of ***images*** returned by specifying the **owner_id** or **architecture**
parameters in the request (**architecture** is one of *x86_64* for 64-bit processors or *i386*
for 32-bit processors). The example below restricts the image list to **64-bit** architecture images
belonging to **owner_id 023801271342**:

      </actions>
    </image>

#### `POST /api/images`

Create a new ***image*** from an existing, running ***instance***. This operation is not
available in all cloud providers and for some cloud providers this operation is not
possible for all ***instances***. For example, in the Amazon EC2 cloud, a custom
***image*** can be created from EBS backed ***instances*** but not from ***root-store***
instances. The Deltacloud API provides a mechanism with which clients can determine whether
a given ***instance*** may be saved as a custom ***image***. For those cases where
***instance*** 'snapshot' is possible, the ***instance*** XML \<actions\> list will
contain a **create_image** action that defines the URI for a client to use in creating
the new image. For example:

    ...
    <actions>
      <link href='http://localhost:3002/api/instances/20109341/reboot' method='post' rel='reboot' />
      <link href='http://localhost:3002/api/instances/20109341/stop' method='post' rel='stop' />
      <link href='http://localhost:3002/api/instances/20109341/run;id=20109341' method='post' rel='run' />
      <link href='http://localhost:3002/api/images;instance_id=20109341' method='post' rel='create_image' />
    </actions>
    ...

To create a new ***image*** the client must specify the *instance_id* of the running instance.
 Optionally, the client may also provide a *name* and a *description*. The parameters may
be specified as multipart/form-data fields in the client POST.

Alternatively, clients may also specify parameters using a content-type of
application/x-www-form-urlencoded. The Deltacloud server will respond to a
successful operation with **HTTP 201 Created** and provide details of the
newly created ***image***:

`Example request:`

    POST /api/images?format=xml HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Basic AU1J3UB2121Afd1DdyQWxLaTYTmJMNF4zTXBoRGdhMDh2RUw5ZDAN9zVXVa==

      </actions>
    </image>


#### `DELETE /api/images/:id`

Deletes the specified ***image*** from the back-end cloud. The Deltacloud server
will return a **HTTP 204 No Content** after a succesful operation:

`Example request:`

    DELETE /api/images/12346145?format=xml HTTP/1.1

### 3.4 Instance States

Each cloud defines a slightly different lifecycle model for ***instances***. In some
clouds, ***instances*** start running immediately after creation, in others, they
enter a pending state and they need to be explicitly started to become
running.

These differences between clouds are modelled by expressing the lifecycle
of an instance as a finite state machine and capturing this in a ***instance states***
entity. The start state of the automaton is start and its final state is
finished. The API defines the following states for an ***instance***:

#####Instance states and their meanings:

    State             Meaning
    -----             -------
    start             Instances are in this state before they are created
    --
    pending           Creation of the instance has been requested and is in progress
    --
    running           The instance is running
    --
    shutting-down     A shutdown has been requested for the instance and is in progress
    --
    stopped           The instance is stopped
    --
    finished          All resources for this instance have now been freed


The actions (state transitions) possible for an ***instance*** are as shown below.
The precise actions that can be performed on a specific ***instance*** are
expressed as part of the details for that ***instance***.

#####Instance actions and their meanings:

    Action            Meaning
    ------            -------
    start             Start the instance
    --
    stop              Stop (and for some providers, Shutdown) the instance
    --
    reboot            Reboot the instance
    --
    destroy           Stop the instance and completely destroy it


#### `GET /api/instance_states`

This call retrieves the ***instance_states*** entity for a back-end cloud. The ***instance_states***
entity defines the transitions possible between the various states of an ***instance***,
and these are back-end cloud specific. In effect ***instance_states*** defines the finite state
machine for ***instances*** from the given cloud.

`Example request:`

    GET /api/instance_states?format=xml HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Basic AU1J3UB2121Afd1DdyQWxLaTYTmJMNF4zTXBoRGdhMDh2RUw5ZDAN9zVXVa==

### 3.5 Instances

An ***instance*** represents the focus of all cloud compute activity: a running
virtual machine. An ***instance*** is created from an ***image***, with a specified
***hardware profile*** and in a given ***realm***. Each ***instance*** can have a
number of other attributes, not all of which are exposed for all back-end cloud
providers. The full list of possible ***instance*** attributes is:

    Attribute           Meaning
    ---------           -------
    owner_id            The id of the cloud provider account that launched the instance
    --
    image_id            The id of the image from which the instance was launched
    --
    name                A human readable name for the instance given at launch time
    --
    realm_id            Realm into which the instance was launced
    --
    state               Current state of the instance (e.g., 'running')
    --
    actions             Actions that a client may effect on the instance, based on current state.
    --
    public_addresses    The globally routable IP address of the instance
    --
    private_addresses   The private IP address of the instance, routable within its private network
    --
    instance_profile    The specific values of memory, cpu, storage
    --
    launch_time         Timestamp at which the instance was launched
    --
    keyname             Name of authentication Key, if this method is used for authentication (e.g., EC2)
    --
    username            The username for authentication when connecting to the instance
    --
    password            The password used together with username above.
    --
    firewalls           The firewalls that this instance was launched into (EC2 specific)
    --

#### `GET /api/instances`

#### `GET /api/instances/:id`

Get the details for a specific ***Instance***. The example shown below is for an ***instance***
launched in the Rackspace Cloudservers cloud. As can be seen, the authentication type used is
**password** but the *username* and *password* attributes are blank. This is because Rackspace
only reports these values once, during instance creation and not for subsequent requests.
An example of the response from ***instance*** creation can be found under the
[POST /api/instances](#create_instance) subsection below, showing how the*username*/*password*
fields are populated.

#### `POST /api/instances/:id/:action`

The valid actions for an ***instance*** are specified by the ***instance_states*** entity.
The set of permissible actions that a client may effect on an ***instance*** at a given time
depends on the current ***instance state***. These are as reported by the \<actions\> attribute
in the Deltacloud server response to a [GET /api/instances/:id](#get_instance) call. The first
example shown below is to **reboot** a currently running instance, followed by a **stop**.

Note that after invoking the **stop** operation, the ***instance*** state may be reported as **RUNNING**
in the Deltacloud server response. This is because it may take some time for the ***instance*** state
 to change in the backend cloud provider (and this will vary between providers). Subsequent requests
 for either the list of ***instances*** or a specific ***instance*** will confirm that the action was
 effected correctly.

The Deltacloud server also allows a special 'run-on-instance' action for some cloud provider
***instances***.This enables a client to perform a command on a running ***instance*** over
**SSH** and the Deltacloud server will return the output of that command to the client.
 Where available, this is reported as the **run** action in the list of ***instance***
actions. The command to be executed on the running ***instance*** is specified by the
**cmd** parameter, whilst authentication is specified either by the **private_key** parameter
for cloud providers that expect key based authentication for connecting to ***instances***
or the **password** parameter for those cloud providers that use a **username/password** for
authentication. The last examples shown below illustrate the 'run-on-instance' feature for
an Amazon EC2 ***instance*** and a Rackspace Cloudservers ***instance***. The two examples
differ in how authentication is performed (private RSA Key for EC2 and username/password
for Rackspace).

<a name=create_instance>.
#### `POST /api/instances`

Create a new ***instance***. At a minimum clients must specify the ***image***
from which the virtual machine ***instance*** is to be created. Optionally a
client may also specify a ***hardware profile*** and ***realm*** (with default
values used otherwise). Clients can also provide a *name* for the new *instance*
 though this is not supported by all back-end cloud providers. Whether a given
feature is available is advertised in the response to the Deltacloud server
API entry point. The details of the new ***instance*** are returned in
response to this operation.

For creation of an ***instance*** in the Amazon EC2 cloud a client can also
specify the name of the EC2 keypair to be used as well as the firewalls
(EC2 security groups) that the ***instance*** should be launched into. The
EC2 keypair is specified with the parameter *keyname* while firewalls are
specified sequentially as *firewalls1* ... *firewalls2* ... etc. These parameters
are specified in the first ***instance*** creation example below. Note that the
values for public and private addresses are blank in the server response, as
these have not yet been assigned by the cloud provider. Subsequent requests
for the ***instance*** details will provide these values.

As with other POST operations in the Deltacloud API, clients may specify parameters
as multipart/form-data or as  x-www-url-form-urlencoded content type, as demonstrated
by the examples below.

The second example given below shows creation of an ***instance*** in the Rackspace
Cloudservers cloud. Here you can see that the client provides the optional *name*
 parameter and that the created instance uses authentication of type **password**.
Furthermore, in this example the requesting client uses a content-type of
application/x-www-form-urlencoded. The *username* and *password* are returned with
the details of the newly created ***instance***:

### 3.6 Keys

A ***key*** captures the credentials required to access an ***Instance***. The
Deltacloud API supports two main types of ***keys***: type **password** which
have *username* and *password* attributes, or type **key** which have
*fingerprint* and *pem* (private key) attributes (public/private keypair).
The key type is determined by the back-end cloud provider.

Some cloud providers require that the client specify the credentials to be used
for connecting to an  ***instance*** as a parameter to ***instance*** creation.
An example is the Amazon EC2 cloud which uses ***keys*** of type **key** and
where the identifier of the **key** to be used with a given ***instance***
is supplied in the *keyname* parameter to the
[POST /api/instances](#create_instance_ec2) call.

Other cloud providers report the ***instance*** credentials in the response to
 ***instance*** creation and make them available for subsequent retrieval. An
example is the Gogrid Cloud, which uses ***keys*** of type  **password**
(note: the Rackspace cloud also reports credentials during ***instance*** creation
though it does not provide a mechanism with which to retrieve those passwords thereafter).

#### `GET /api/keys`

This gives a listing of all available keys. The example shown below is for
***keys*** from the Amazon EC2 cloud, which are of type **key**. Note that the
XML response does not contain the private key attribute. This is because EC2 only
provides the private key once, when the key is created (see
[key creation](#key_create) for an example):

<a name=get_keys>.

        <state></state>
    </key>

#### `POST /api/keys`

Some back-end cloud providers allow a client to create new credentials for
accessing Instances. The parameters (key attributes) required by this function
will depend on the back-end and are specified in the relevant driver. At
present only the Amazon EC2 cloud implements a key create method and this
requires the key *name* to be specified as a parameter. It should be noted that
the private key attribute of a newly created key is reported only once, in
response to the create operation as shown in the example below.
The client should save the private key for future use with  ***instance***
authentication. In all subsequent calls, only the fingerprint attribute
is displayed in the Deltacloud server response, as illustrated by
the [GET /api/keys](#get_keys) call above.

Note that as with other HTTP POST calls in the Deltacloud REST API, client requests
may specify the required parameters as multipart/form-data, or using the
application/x-www-form-urlencoded content type.

<a name=key_create>.

### 3.7 Firewalls

Firewalls represent sets of rules that govern the accessibility of a running
 ***instance*** over the  public Internet. At present only the Amazon EC2 cloud
supports this collection (Amazon EC2 'Security Groups'). A ***firewall*** has
a **name** and **description**, an **owner_id** and a set of **rules**. An
***instance*** is 'launched into' a ***firewall*** where this is supported,
by specifying the **firewalls1 ... firewallsN** parameters in the
 [POST /api/instances](#create_instance_ec2) operation.

Each ***firewall rule*** has a number of attributes describing the access granted
to clients that want to communicate with the ***instance*** over the Internet.
Each rule has an **allow_protocol** (*tcp*, *udp*  or *icmp*) a **port_from**
and **port_to** that delimit the port range for access, a **sources** list which
can contain ***firewalls*** (i.e. allow ***instances*** in another ***firewall***
to communicate with ***instances*** in the ***firewall*** in which this rule exists),
or a number of IP addresses in CIDR format, or  a mix of both. Finally each rule
also specifies a **direction**, indicating whether it applies to ingress
or egress traffic.

As Amazon EC2 has no notion of a ***firewall rule*** ID, the Deltacloud server constructs one
for each rule as the concatenation of its attributes. The format used is:
owner\_id~protocol~from\_port~to\_port~@sources.

As explained above a source can be of type **address** in which case it defines an
*IP type* (ipv4/ipv6), an *IP address* and *routing prefix* (CIDR netmask). Sources
of type **group** have a *name* that defines the ***firewall*** to which access
is being granted and an *owner_id* (identifier of the account that created the
specified firewall).

An example of a rule id is:

    393485797142~tcp~22~22~@group,393485797142,default,@address,ipv4,10.1.2.3,24
              {owner_id~protocol~from_port~to_port~@sources}

By creating the rule identifier abstraction, the Deltacloud API supports deletion of
an entire firewall rule as one operation,
[DELETE /api/firewalls/:firewall_id/:rule_id](#delete_firewall_rule).

#### `POST /api/firewalls`

Creates a new ***firewall***. Clients must specify the ***firewall*** *name*
and *description* as parameters to the request. On succesful completion the
Deltacloud server will respond with **HTTP 201 Created** and return details
of the newly created ***firewall***. As with other POST operations in the
Deltacloud API, a client may specify parameters as multipart/form-data or using

#### `DELETE /api/firewalls/:id`

Deletes the specified ***firewall*** from the back-end cloud provider. The Deltacloud
server will respond with **HTTP 204 No Content** after a successful deletion:

`Example request:`

    DELETE /api/firewalls/test?format=xml HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Basic AU1J3UB2121Afd1DdyQWxLaTYTmJMNF4zTXBoRGdhMDh2RUw5ZDAN9zVXVa==
    User-Agent: curl/7.20.1 (i386-redhat-linux-gnu)
    Host: localhost:3001
    Accept: */*

`Client response:`

    HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
    Date: Wed, 27 Jul 2011 09:47:43 GMT

The rules governing the deletion of a ***firewall*** are back-end cloud specific.
Since at present only the Amazon EC2 cloud supports the ***firewalls*** collection
we describe the ***firewall*** deletion rules for EC2 here.

It is permitted to delete a ***firewall*** that has rules defined within it, with
two caveats. You cannot delete a  ***firewall*** if it is referenced by another
***firewall***; for instance  **firewall_1** has a rule giving access to
**firewall_2**. An attempt to delete **firewall_2** will result in the error
**InvalidGroup.InUse**, as shown in the example below. The second caveat is that
you cannot delete a ***firewall*** if there are currently any running ***instances***
within that ***firewall*** (i.e. ***instances*** that specified the given
***firewall*** when they were launched). The error message in that case is
**InvalidGroup.InUse: There are active instances using security group**. In both
cases the error message is propagated from the back-end cloud provider to the
requesting client:

`Example request: (error deleting a firewall referenced by another firewall)`

    DELETE /api/firewalls/firewall_2?format=xml HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Basic AU1J3UB2121Afd1DdyQWxLaTYTmJMNF4zTXBoRGdhMDh2RUw5ZDAN9zVXVa==

    </error>

#### `POST /api/firewalls/:id/rules`

Create a new ***firewall rule*** within a specified ***firewall***. A client
must supply the **protocol** (one of *udp*, *tcp* or *icmp*), **port_from**
and **port_to** as parameters. Ofcourse the client must also specify the
**sources** to which the given rule is to apply. IP addresses are specified
in CIDR format sequentially: *ip_address1=192.168.10.10/24*,
*ip_address2=10.1.1.1/16* ... *ip_addressN=...*. The IP address '0.0.0.0/0'
acts as a wildcard to specify **any** IP address. Source ***firewalls*** are
also specified sequentially but the *owner_id* of the ***firewall*** that is
to be authorized must also be supplied (this is an Amazon EC2 requirement):
group1=name1, group1owner=1234567890, group2=name2, group2owner=0987654321,
... groupN=nameN, groupNowner=...

The Deltacloud server responds with a **HTTP 201 Created** after a successful
operation together with the details of the affected ***firewall***. The example
client request below specifies the required parameters as multipart/form-data.
However clients may also legitimately use the application/x-www-form-urlencoded
to provide firewall rule parameters.

`Example request:`

    POST /api/firewalls/default/rules?format=xml HTTP/1.1

### 3.8 Addresses

The ***addresses*** collection represents IP addresses and is intended to allow
IP address management. This collection is currently implemented for the Amazon
EC2 cloud driver. For EC2, IP address management corresponds to Amazon's
'Elastic IP' feature. As such, the ***addresses*** collection supports operations
for creating or destroying an ***address*** as well as associating or
disassociating an ***address*** from a running ***instance***.

#### `GET /api/addresses`

Retrieve a list of all ***addresses***:

`Example request:`

    GET /api/addresses?format=xml HTTP/1.1

`Server response:`

    HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
    Date: Wed, 27 Jul 2011 13:29:00 GMT

#### `POST /api/addresses/:id/associate`

This operation associates a given ***address*** with a running ***instance***.
The client must specify the *instance_id* as a parameter to this call.
For Amazon EC2, the specified ***address*** will replace the currently assigned
*public_address* of the ***instance***. A succesful operation will produce a
**HTTP 202 Accepted** response. The example client request below specifies the
required  *instance_id* parameter using the application/x-www-form-urlencoded
content-type, however this can also legitimately be specified using
multipart/form-data.

`Example request:`

    POST /api/addresses/107.20.232.251/associate?format=xml HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Basic AU1J3UB2121Afd1DdyQWxLaTYTmJMNF4zTXBoRGdhMDh2RUw5ZDAN9zVXVa==

### 3.9 Load Balancers

***Load balancers*** allow distribution of ingress network traffic received by a
 specified IP address to a number of running ***instances***. For example, a
number of ***instances*** that are fulfilling the role of web servers can be
attached to a single ***load_balancer***. This would allow handling of large
numbers of requests without degradation to the website performance.

This collection is not supported by all back-end cloud providers and at present
is implemented for the Gogrid and Amazon EC2 cloud drivers. A
***load_balancer*** is launched into a specific ***realm*** and typically only
 ***instances*** within that ***realm*** may be 'attached' to the balancer. Each
***load_balancer*** also has a list of ***instances***, a **public address**
representing the IP address that the balancer will respond to client requests
on, a **created_at** timestamp and a list of **listeners**. Each **listener**
has a **protocol** (e.g., 'TCP'), a **load balancer port** and an
**instance port** which represent the network ports on which the balancer accepts
connections and the port to which network traffic is forwarded to ***instances***
in the **instance list**, respectively.

#### `GET /api/load_balancers`

Retrieves details of all ***load_balancers***

`Example request:`

#### `POST /api/load_balancers`

This operation creates a new ***load_balancer***. Clients must provide the
***load_balancer*** **name**, the **realm_id** to which the balancer is to
apply, a **listener_protocol** which the balancer will respond to (one of
**HTTP** or **TCP**), the **listener_balancer_port** which specifies the port
that the ***load_balancer*** will be expecting network traffic on and finally
the **listener_instance_port** which specifies the port on which ***instances***
will be receiving network traffic forwarded by the ***load_balancer***. As with
other operations in the Deltacloud API, parameters may be specified by a requesting
client using multipart/form-data or as application/x-www-form-urlencoded data
as shown below:

## 4. Storage Resources

Storage resources are divided into two groups: ***storage volumes*** can be attached
to a running instance (accessible by the instance OS), and *blob storage*
which represents a generic 'key <−−> value' based data store, as implemented
by Rackspace CloudFiles or Amazon S3. ***Storage snapshots*** represent a
***storage volume***, a backup of which is created at a particular point in time
(a snapshot).

### 4.1 Storage Volumes

A ***storage_volume*** has a **capacity** expressed in Gigabytes, a **created**
timestamp, a **realm_id** specifying the ***realm*** in which the volume exists,
a **state** (for Amazon EC2 this is one of creating | available | in-use | deleting
| deleted | error) and a set of **actions**. When attached to an ***instance***,
a ***storage_volume*** will also expose a **mount** element which contains the
attributes **instance** and **device**, specifying the ***instance*** to which
the volume is attached and the mount point (e.g. /dev/sdh), respectively.

#### `GET /api/storage_volumes`

List all ***storage volumes***.

`Example request:`

    GET /api/storage_volumes?format=xml HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Basic AU1J3UB2121Afd1DdyQWxLaTYTmJMNF4zTXBoRGdhMDh2RUw5ZDAN9zVXVa==

      </actions>
    </storage_volume>

#### `POST /api/storage_volumes`

This operation will create a new ***storage_volume***. A client may specify a
**snapshot_id** from which to instantiate the ***storage_volume*** though this
is optional. The **capacity** parameter, expressed in Gigabytes, is also optional
and will default to 1 Gigabyte. Finally clients may also specify the **realm_id**
as a ***storage_volume*** can typically only be attached to ***instances***
 running within the specified ***realm***. If the ***realm*** is not specified
it will default to the first realm returned by the cloud provider.
A succesful operation will return **HTTP 201 Created** with the details of
the newly created ***storage_volume***.

As with the other **POST** operations in the Deltacloud API, clients
may choose to specify operation parameters as multipart/form-data or
as application/x-www-form-urlencoded data.


`Example request:`

    POST /api/storage_volumes?format=xml HTTP/1.1

#### `DELETE /api/storage_volumes/:id`

Deletes the specified ***storage_volume***. The operation will return a
**HTTP 204 No Content** after a succesful operation. Note that the operation will
fail if the given ***storage_volume*** is currently attached to an ***instance***.

`Example request:`

#### `POST /api/storage_volumes/:id/attach`

This operation will attach the specified ***storage_volume*** to a running
***instance***. Clients must specify the **instance_id** and the **device**
as parameters. The **device** parameter is used as the 'mount point', that is,
 the location at which the ***storage_volume*** will be exposed to the given
***instance*** (e.g., /dev/sdh). The Deltacloud server will respond with a
**HTTP 202 Accepted** after a succesful attach operation together with details
of the ***storage_volume***. Note in the example below that the **state** is
reported as 'unknown' although the **mount** element is present, as the
processing has not yet been completed (hence the **202** status code).
Clients may specify the required parameters as multipart/form-data
or as application/x-www-form-urlencoded data.

`Example request:`

    POST /api/storage_volumes/vol-0bc0de60/attach?format=xml HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Basic AU1J3UB2121Afd1DdyQWxLaTYTmJMNF4zTXBoRGdhMDh2RUw5ZDAN9zVXVa==

      </actions>
    </storage_volume>


#### `POST /api/storage_volumes/:id/detach`

This operation detaches the given ***storage_volume*** from the ***instance***
to which it is currently attached. A succesful operation will return
**HTTP 201 Accepted** together with details of the ***storage_volume***. Note
in the example that like the ***attach*** operation above, **state** is
 reported as 'unknown' and the **mount** element is still present as the
processing has not yet been completed (hence the **202** status code).

`Example request:`

    POST /api/storage_volumes/vol-0bc0de60/detach?format=xml HTTP/1.1

### 4.2 Storage Snapshots

A ***storage_snapshot*** captures the point-in-time state of a ***storage_volume***.
Each snapshot has a **created** timestamp, and a ***storage_volume*** attribute
referring to the volume from which the snapshot was made.

#### `GET /api/storage_snapshots`

List all available ***storage snapshots***. For Amazon EC2 this list includes
*any* snapshots that are available to the requesting client account, including
those that may not have been created by that account. As this list is very long

### 4.3 Blob Storage

Blob storage represents a generic *key* ==> *value* data store, as implemented by Amazon S3
or Rackspace Cloudfiles. In Deltacloud, the organisational unit of blob storage is a
 ***Bucket***. Individual data items, ***Blobs*** are exposed as a subcollection
under each ***Bucket***.

A ***bucket*** has a ***name***, a **size** (denotes the number of ***blobs*** it
contains) and a list of links to each ***blob***.

A ***blob*** has a **content_length**, a **content_type**, a **last_modified**
timestamp, a structure containing **user_metadata**, a link to the blob **content**
 and the name of the ***bucket*** in which this ***blob*** exists.

#### `GET /api/buckets`

Returns a list of all ***buckets*** belonging to the given cloud provider account.
The response from the Deltacloud server includes the *name* and *URI* of each
***bucket*** but not the *size* or the list of ***blobs*** contained within them.
 These details are available when a client requests (*GET*s) a specific ***bucket***.

`Example request:`

    GET /api/buckets?format=xml HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Basic AU1J3UB2121Afd1DdyQWxLaTYTmJMNF4zTXBoRGdhMDh2RUw5ZDAN9zVXVa==
    User-Agent: curl/7.20.1
    Host: localhost:3001
    Accept: */*

`Server response:`

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/xml
    Content-Length: 597
    <?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8' ?>

        <name>mybucket4</name>
        <size></size>
      </bucket>
    </buckets>

#### `GET /api/buckets/:id`

Returns the details of a specific ***bucket***, as shown below. The Deltacloud server
response includes the *size* of the ***bucket*** and the URI for each ***blob*** object
that it contains.

`Example request:`

    GET /api/buckets/mybucket1?format=xml HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Basic AU1J3UB2121Afd1DdyQWxLaTYTmJMNF4zTXBoRGdhMDh2RUw5ZDAN9zVXVa==
    User-Agent: curl/7.20.1
    Host: localhost:3001
    Accept: */*

`Server response:`

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/xml
    Content-Length: 534
    <?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8' ?>

      <blob href='http://localhost:3001/api/buckets/mybucket1/picture_blob' id='picture_blob'></blob>
      <blob href='http://localhost:3001/api/buckets/mybucket1/some_blob id='some_blob'></blob>
    </bucket>


#### `POST /api/buckets`

Creates a new ***bucket*** and requires that you specify the ***name*** as a
parameter. Optionally for Amazon S3 buckets, you can specify a bucket location
with the ***location*** parameter, as per
 [Regions and Endpoints for Amazon Simple Storage Service](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/general/latest/gr/index.html?rande.html "AWS Regions and Endpoints");
valid values for S3 bucket *location* parameter are: "us-west-1", "EU",
"ap-southeast-1", "ap-northeast-1" (while not specifying a location defaults to
the "US Standard" region). Note that clients may specify parameters as
multipart/form-data or using a content-type of application/x-www-form-urlencoded.

On succesful creation this call will return a ***201*** HTTP status, specifying
the URI of the newly created bucket in the **Location** header and the newly
created ***bucket*** object in the response message body. The example request
below creates a new ***bucket*** in the *EU (Ireland)* region. If the given
backend cloud does not support locations then the *location* parameter is
silently ignored.

`Example request:`

    POST /api/buckets?format=xml HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Basic AU1J3UB2121Afd1DdyQWxLaTYTmJMNF4zTXBoRGdhMDh2RUw5ZDAN9zVXVa==

    Location: http://localhost:3001/api/buckets/mybucketeurope
    Content-Type: application/xml
    Content-Length: 182

      <name>mybucketeurope</name>
      <size>0</size>
    </bucket>

<a name=delete_bucket>.
#### `DELETE /api/buckets/:id`

Deletes the specified ***bucket***, which must be empty (otherwise the call will
fail with an error response). A succesful operation will return ***204 No Content***.

`Example request:`

    DELETE /api/buckets/mybucketeurope?format=xml HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Basic AU1J3UB2121Afd1DdyQWxLaTYTmJMNF4zTXBoRGdhMDh2RUw5ZDAN9zVXVa==
    User-Agent: curl/7.20.1 (i386-redhat-linux-gnu)
    Host: localhost:3001
    Accept: */*

`Server response:`

    HTTP/1.1 204 No Content


#### `GET /api/buckets/:bucket_id/:blob_id`

Retrieve the details of a specific ***blob***. The ***blob*** content is *not* returned
as part of the response but rather a URI is given from which the content may be
retrieved as shown below:

`Example request:`

    GET /api/buckets/mariosbucket1/some_more_blob_woo?format=xml HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Basic AU1J3UB2121Afd1DdyQWxLaTYTmJMNF4zTXBoRGdhMDh2RUw5ZDAN9zVXVa==
    User-Agent: curl/7.20.1 (i386-redhat-linux-gnu)
    Host: localhost:3001
    Accept: */*

`Server response:`

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/xml
    Content-Length: 586
    <?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8' ?>

        </entry>
      </user_metadata>
      <content href='http://localhost:3001/api/buckets/mariosbucket1/some_more_blob_woo/content'></content>
    </blob>

#### `GET /api/buckets/:bucket_id/:blob_id/content`

Retrieve the actual blob content, the location of which is specified in the ***content***
URI returned from the `GET /api/buckets/:bucket_id/:blob_id` call. The content is streamed
through the deltacloud server as this is received from the back-end cloud provider, to
avoid the creation of a temporary file (especially significant in the case of large
***blobs***). The Deltacloud server sets *Content-Disposition: attachment;
filename=blob_name* in the HTTP response headers.

`Example request:`

    GET /api/buckets/mariosanotherbucketohyeah/Im_a_blob_beholdme/content?format=xml HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Basic AU1J3UB2121Afd1DdyQWxLaTYTmJMNF4zTXBoRGdhMDh2RUw5ZDAN9zVXVa==
    User-Agent: curl/7.20.1 (i386-redhat-linux-gnu)
    Host: localhost:3001
    Accept: */*

`Server response:`

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=Im_a_blob_beholdme
    Content-Type: text/plain
    Content-Length: 50

    <BLOB DATA HERE>

<a name=create_blob>.
#### `PUT /api/buckets/:bucket_id/:blob_id`

Creates a ***blob*** object and sets its content. If the ***blob*** already exists then
its data and metadata are overwritten with those specified in this call. The request
must specify the *name* of the ***blob*** and the *name* of the ***bucket*** in which
the ***blob*** is to be placed, in the call URI. The client must also specify in the
HTTP headers the *content_length* of the ***blob*** data and the ***blob*** data
itself. Optionally the call may also specify a *content_type* and any number of
***key:value*** pairs of user defined *metadata*. User metadata is defined using
'X-Deltacloud-Blobmeta-' header, e.g. ***X-Deltacloud-Blobmeta-Version:2.1***.

To eliminate the necessity of creating a local file at the deltacloud server for
each ***blob*** created, the deltacloud server starts to stream the blob data to
the back-end cloud provider as soon as the request headers are processed. A
succesful operation will return the newly created blob object, as shown below:

`Example request:`

    PUT /api/buckets/mybucket/12Jul2011blob?format=xml HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Basic AU1J3UB2121Afd1DdyQWxLaTYTmJMNF4zTXBoRGdhMDh2RUw5ZDAN9zVXVa==
    Content-Type: text/plain
    Content-Length: 128988
    X-Deltacloud-Blobmeta-Version:2.1
    X-Deltacloud-Blobmeta-Author:msa

    ... BLOB DATA ...

`Server response:`
    <?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8' ?>
    <blob href='http://localhost:3001/api/buckets/mybucket/12Jul2011blob' id='12Jul2011blob'>

      <content_length>128988</content_length>
      <content_type>text/plain</content_type>

          <![CDATA[msa]]>
        </entry>

          <![CDATA[2.1]]>
        </entry>
      </user_metadata>
      <content href='http://localhost:3001/api/buckets/mybucket/12Jul2011blob/content'>
      </content>
    </blob>

#### `POST /api/buckets/:bucket_id`

The deltacloud server also responds to an alternative `POST` route for creating or
updating a ***blob*** object. As with the `PUT` method for creating/updating a
***blob***, the client must specify the ***bucket*** in which the ***blob*** is to
be created through the call URI (i.e. you `POST` to the specified ***bucket***).
The rest of the required fields, that is, the name of the ***blob***, the
 ***blob_data*** and the ***content-length*** are specified by the client as
***multipart/form-data*** (i.e. in `HTTP POST` form fields).

In order to specify the optional user metadata for a given ***blob*** the client
must set the form field ***meta_params*** to specify the number of metadata
key/value pairs. The metadata itself is then specified by the client with fields
of the form ***meta_nameN*** and ***meta_valueN*** where *N* is an integer from
*1* upto the number specified by the ***meta_params*** field (e.g.
***meta_name1=author***, ***meta_value1=jrd***).

It should be noted that the `POST` method for creating a blob is *non streaming*
- that is, the Deltacloud server will create a temporary file with the blob data,
before this is transferred to the backend cloud. Thus, it should only be used for
***blobs*** with a relatively small content-length and in general the `PUT` method
should be preferred for larger ***blobs***. This `POST` method is mainly provided
for clients that cannot easily invoke a `HTTP PUT` operation (for instance,
web browsers) and can be used for creating/updating a  ***blob*** through the
deltacloud HTML interface (provided for testing purposes).

`Example request:`

#### `DELETE /api/buckets/:bucket_id/:blob_id`

This call deletes the specified ***blob*** object from the back-end cloud. The names
of the ***blob*** and the ***bucket*** in which this exists are specified the in call
URI. After a succesful operation the Deltacloud server will respond with a `HTTP 204`
 (No Content) with no message body.

`Example request:`

    DELETE /api/buckets/mybucket/12Jul2011blob?format=xml HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Basic AU1J3UB2121Afd1DdyQWxLaTYTmJMNF4zTXBoRGdhMDh2RUw5ZDAN9zVXVa==
    User-Agent: curl/7.20.1 (i386-redhat-linux-gnu)

    Accept: */*

`Server response:`

    HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
    Connection: close
    Server: thin 1.2.11


#### `HEAD /api/buckets/:bucket_id/:blob_id`

The `HTTP HEAD` operation on a specified ***blob*** URI will return all user defined
metadata fields. As per [RFC 2616](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt "RFC 2616 HTTP/1.1")
this `HEAD` operation does not return a message body. Rather, the ***blob*** user
metadata values are returned in the response ***X-Deltacloud-Blobmeta-***
headers (e.g., X-Deltacloud-Blobmeta-version:1.2).

`Example request:`

    HEAD /api/buckets/mybucket/myblob?format=xml HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Basic AU1J3UB2121Afd1DdyQWxLaTYTmJMNF4zTXBoRGdhMDh2RUw5ZDAN9zVXVa==

`Server response:`

    HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
    X-Deltacloud-Blobmeta-version: 1.21
    X-Deltacloud-Blobmeta-author: jrd

#### `POST /api/buckets/:bucket_id/:blob_id`

A `POST` operation on the URI of a ***blob*** allows a client to update the user-defined
***blob metadata***. Note that this operation will overwrite all previously set
user-metadata values (if any) and replace them with those specified in this call.
The client must set the user-defined metadata in the ***X-Deltacloud-Blobmeta-***
headers (e.g., X-Deltacloud-Blobmeta-Model:2012).

`Example request:`

    POST /api/buckets/mybucket/myblob?format=xml HTTP/1.1
