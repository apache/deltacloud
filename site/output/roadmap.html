        <h1>Deltacloud Roadmap</h1>
        
        <p>The current roadmap is maintained in
        <a href="https://teambox.com/projects/deltacloud/task_lists">teambox</a> where anybody
        can comment on tasks, and suggest new features.</p>
        
        <h1>Ye olde roadmap</h1>
        
        <p><em>This list is no longer maintained. It's only here for historical
        purposes. To see the current roadmap, go to
        <a href="https://teambox.com/projects/deltacloud/task_lists">teambox</a></em></p>
        
        <p>This page lists the items we are currently working on for the next release,
        and a longer list of items we will address after the next release, roughly
        in order of priority.</p>
        
        <p>If you have anything you'd like to see added to the roadmap, or think that
        some items should receive more attention, please let us know on the
        <a href="/contribute.html">mailing list</a>. Of course, the quickest way to get anything into
        Deltacloud is to <a href="/contribute.html">send us patches</a> &mdash; we will of course take patches
        for anything, regardless of whether they adress items on the roadmap or
        anything else.</p>

        </ul></p>
        
        <h2 id="h1">Next release</h2>
        
        <p>This release will happen in mid to late January 2011. We very much hope to
        include all the items below, but might have to defer some of them,
        depending on the progress we make (and the amount of patches we receive)</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Upload/creation of blobs</strong>: the <code>/buckets</code> collection allows
        downloading blobs stored within buckets, but not yet creating and
        uploading them. The big challenge here is streaming the content to be
        uploaded to the backend cloud.</li>
        <li><strong>Update Apache Website</strong>: mostly housekeeping to make sure the
        information on the site is accurate, and to update the documentation on
        the site</li>
        <li><strong>Capabilities for introspection</strong>: provide a lot more information to
        clients about what each driver actually supports; for example, this makes
        it possible for clients to discover if the driver supports rebooting
        instances</li>
        <li><strong>RHEV-M driver</strong>: RHEV-M has a new, shiny, and very nice,
        <a href="http://markmc.fedorapeople.org/rhevm-api/en-US/html/index.html">REST API</a>. The
        RHEV-M driver needs to be rewritten to take advantage of that.</li>
        <li><strong>Formal API docs</strong>: A document that describes, in great detail, each
        possible call in the API, parameters, results, errors, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Load balancers</strong>: Add a new toplevel collection that can be used to
        manage load balancers in clouds that allow that (e.g., EC2)</li>
        <li><strong>Runtime driver selection</strong>: So far, the driver to use is selected when
        you start the Deltacloud server; this becomes very unwieldy with clouds
        that offer multiple endpoints/regions, and with internal clouds. We'll
        make it possible to select the driver, and the API endpoint that the
        server uses through HTTP headers</li>
        <li><strong>Store blobs in tempfile by default</strong>: Rack doesn't have a universal way
        to stream blobs, either for upload or download; the only Rack conformant
        way to deal with large objects is to store them in temporary files -
        we'll make that the default, and add proper streaming for some of the
        more popular servers (most likely <code>thin</code> for now)</li>
        <li><strong>Rewritten EC2 driver</strong>: the current EC2 driver depends on too many
        API-wrapper gems; a rewrite will make sure we only use one gem (AWS) for
        it</li>
        <li><strong>Launch multiple instances with one call</strong>: The API right now allows
        only creating single instances. For clouds that support it, the API
        should allow launching many instances in one operation.</li>
        <li><strong>Remote command execution</strong>: Add a way to log into an instance and run a
        commend there as one API call</li>
        <li><strong>Clarify shutdown semantics</strong>: the various drivers are a little squishy
        on whether shutting down means a clean ACPI shutdown or yanking the
        (virtual) power chord out of the instance</li>
        <li><strong>Create images from uploaded bits</strong>: Allow posting to the <code>/images</code>
        collection so that bits in appropriate storage can be designated as
        images</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <h2 id="h2">Backlog</h2>
        
        <p>These are items we think we'll work on in future releases. There is no
        guarantee that we will actually wind up doing that &mdash; listing them
        here simply means that they seem like a good idea today. The list is
        roughly in the order in which we think the items should be addressed, with
        the most pressing ones at the top of the list.</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Dev guide/tutorials</strong>: documentation to make it easier for people to
        get started using Deltacloud</li>
        <li><strong>Report password on instance creation (Rackspace)</strong>: in Rackspace, you
        get a random root password when you create an insatnce, and it is only
        sent at instance creation.</li>
        <li><strong>File injection (Rackspace)</strong>: support direct injection of files into
        the instance</li>
        <li><strong>Create image from running server</strong>: in many clouds, that's the only way
        to create images. Support a magic call that sets the machinery to freeze
        a running instance into an image in motion</li>
        <li><strong>Driver for Google storage</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Improve streaming support for blobs</strong>: stream uploads; probably need to
        support streaming for more than just <code>thin</code> (torquebox ? passenger ?)</li>
        <li><strong>Partial Upload</strong>: several storage services allow uploading and
        downloading ranges of a blob, often also in parallel. Add that feature to
        Deltaclouds storage API</li>
        <li><strong>Billing info</strong>: define a model and API calls to represent billing
        information and the billing model of the cloud. The aim is to make it
        possible for clients to find out how much and why they are being charged
        for current resource usage, and to enable them to make <em>what if</em>
        computations. Since none of the public clouds support that, needs to be
        done carefully in conjunction with some of the open-source players,
        especially RHEV-M</li>
        <li><strong>Attach EBS</strong>: attach block storage to instances in EC2</li>
        <li><strong>Formal testing against live clouds</strong>: run the test suite against each
        cloud we support on a regular basis</li>
        <li><strong>vCloud driver</strong>: full support for VMWare's <em>vCloud</em> so we can talk to
        these private clouds</li>
        <li><strong>Stateful instances</strong>: the API is very much focussed on stateless
        instances (with a couple of exceptions) Cleanly define handling stateless
        and stateful side-by-side</li>
        <li><strong>IP address mgmt</strong>: another toplevel collection to represent the IP
        addresses your account owns/has access to</li>
        <li><strong>Apply public IP(s) to server</strong>: support things like EC2's elastic IP</li>
        <li><strong>Manage password lists</strong>: some clouds allow predefining a list of
        passwords and then applying them to instances. Support managing these
        lists</li>
        <li><strong>technology compatibility kit</strong>: a test suite that can be run against an
        implementation of the Deltacloud API and report on any problems with the
        API implementation</li>
        <li><strong>Firewalls</strong>: there are a couple <em>very</em> different models out there how
        instances can be firewalled from the rest of the cloud and from the
        internet at large. Support defining and manging firewall rules and
        applying them to instances</li>
        <li><strong>Public Deltacloud instances</strong>: it would be nice for testing etc. to
        have a few Deltacloud instances running at a well-known address</li>
        <li><strong>Spot instances</strong>: Support EC2's auction-based way of running instances</li>
        <li><strong>Reserved instances</strong>: Support EC2's preallocated instances</li>
        <li><strong>Bare-metal servers</strong>: some clouds also manage physical bare-metal
        servers</li>
        <li><strong>Text/graphical console</strong>: As much as possible, make it possible for
        clients to open an interactive console; this is very speculative, and not
        possible in most clouds</li>
        <li><strong>Console logs</strong>: access whatever logs the backend cloud API produces for
        an instance through Deltacloud</li>
        <li><strong>IBM cloud driver</strong></li>
        <li><strong>NTT cloud driver</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Monitoring (Cloudwatch)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Error reporting</strong>: clean up forwarding of backend errors</li>
        <li><strong>Account creation/registration</strong>: make it possible to create an account
        in various backend clouds through Deltacloud</li>
        </ul>

          Apache Deltacloud is an effort undergoing incubation at The
          Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the name of
          sponsor. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects
          until a further review indicates that the infrastructure,
          communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a
          manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While
          incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the
          completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the
          project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
